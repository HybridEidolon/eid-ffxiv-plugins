# Eidolon's FFXIV Plugins

Various plugins for the Dalamud plugin loader.

## DynamicUIScaling

Overrides the game's hi-resolution scale behavior to automatically scale
precisely to a factored base resolution, retaining all window placement
behavior. If you play the game at the same consistent aspect ratio at different
resolutions, your windows will be arranged exactly as you intend, even if the
scale factor would bring the global UI scale below 100%.

For World of Warcraft players, this behaves similarly to the UI scaling option
there, except instead of a base resolution of 1024x768, it is 1280x720.
